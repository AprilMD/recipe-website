    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Little is more satisfying than cooking a classic to perfection – Sarah Cook gives us a lesson in how to make lasagne</p>
        <h3>Prepare Ahead</h3>
            <p>Assemble the lasagne completely, then cool. Store in an airtight container and freeze for up to three months. Transfer to the fridge 48 hrs before you want to cook it to defrost, 
        then bake as directed, checking after 1 hr in case it needs an extra 10-15 mins. (If you’ve frozen any leftovers, defrost in the fridge, then reheat in the microwave until piping hot).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot (about 100g), finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>140g cubetti di pancetta</li>
            <li>500g beef mince (we used 10% fat)</li>
            <li>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>..etc</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make the béchamel sauce. Put the milk, onion, bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan and bring very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.</li>
            <li>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan. Gently cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.</li>
            <li>Tip in the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and break up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down, stir in all the herbs, the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hr, stirring occasionally to stop the bottom catching.</li>
            <li>Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 mins-1 hr until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and season.</li>
            <li>To finish the béchamel sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs. Melt the butter in the same pan then, using a wooden spoon, mix in the flour and cook for 2 mins.</li>
            <li>..etc</li>
        </ol>
